 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the English
alphabet at least once. Pangrams are often used to test fonts, keyboards, and other text-related

down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”

“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”
“It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.”
“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked

“I know,” the old man said. “It is quite normal.”
“He hasn’t much faith.”
[10] “No,” the old man said. “But we have. Haven’t we?”
“Yes,” the boy said. “Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we’ll take the stuff
home.”
“Why not?” the old man said. “Between fishermen.”
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he
was noteangry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did
not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted
their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful
fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried
them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank,
to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
factory; but today there [11] was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had
backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
“Santiago,” the boy said.
“Yes,” the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
“Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?”
“No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net.”
“I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you. I would like to serve in some way.”
“You bought me a beer,” the old man said. “You are already a man.”
“How old was I when you first took me in a boat?”
“Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly
tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?”
“I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the
noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled
lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like
chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me.”
[12] “Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?”

I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway
www.Asiaing.com
To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”
The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”
“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks.”
